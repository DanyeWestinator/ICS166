    At least you are able to shoot out something. It's not everyday you get to see lightning come out from someone's hands."

    I am a god."
    z "This is so humiliating."

    j "Now that I think about it, you mentioned how a god\'s power is measured by their number of followers right?"

    z "Yeah, what about it?"

    j "That explains it.
    You see, gods aren't really worshipped anymore."
    j "Now-a-days, people believe in what they can actually see.
    It's more about famous actors and idols. There are even online celebrities being worshipped."

    z "Eh?\nYou're kidding right?\nWe are talking about gods here. Legendary beings who can control nature itself."
    z "And you're telling me that a mere human is being worshipped more than a god?"

    j "*Nods*"

    z "And it just keeps getting worse. When I got here, I thought I would have to, at worst, get people to worship me as a god again."
    z "But, I can't even hope for that now?"

    z "Go ahead and laugh at this god that can\'t even get a mere farmer to worship him."

    j "Ah. No it's nothing like that."
