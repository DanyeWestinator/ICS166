    j "I think getting people to worship you as a god is right out. People don't worship Zeus and Hera much in 2041."
    z "And why, in the name of Cerberus's furballs, do people not still worship my majesty?"
    j "That's just not what people worship now-a-days. Instead, I think we could make you famous for something else. Get you InstaBlab followers, enough to get you back home."

    z "Are you asking me to drop to the level of a human and throw away my pride as a god?"

    j "I'm pretty sure you are no different from a human at this point."
    j "Plus I think that you would have more of a shot with this than with your original plan."
    j "Which last time I checked, didn't exist."

    z "*sigh* Fine then. Let's go with your idea."
    z "What should we do first?"

    j "Well I was thinking of how we should go about this."
    j "There are a lot of social media platforms to start out on."

    z "Social media? Platform?"
    z "Ah, like the Theatre of Dionysus."

    j "I think so?"
    j "Think of it more like a place to post images and updates about your life."

    z "So, no theatre?"

    j "No theatre."
    j "Do you have that phone from the mall?"
    z "perhaps you will have more luck coaxing an intelligable reaction from the thing than I had."
