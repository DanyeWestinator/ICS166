    j "Here pass me the phone real quick. I will set you up with a InstaBlab account."
    j "Just a second."
    j "And there we have it. Now we are just going to need some pictures."
    z "Now where do we find a painter around here, unless you are both a farmer and a skilled artisan."
    j "No we don't need a painter for this. This phone here is capable of taking realistic photos at a moments notice."
    z "Quite an incredible contraption. It really seems to do everything for you mortals."
    j "No quite everything but it does do a lot."
    j "Now stand over there and I can take a picture."
    z "Just like this?"
    j "Ya that's fine."
    j "And done."
    z "Wait it is really that quick?"
    j "Yep that is all it takes."
    z "This is much easier than I ever imagined. So what now."
    j "Well, next we would post it, but I feel like it is missing something to make it stand out."
    z "What do you mean it is missing something? A picture this realistic of the King of Olympus must surely be more than enough to impress people."
    j "To people these days, it just looks like any old picture of a dude out in a field."
    z "I am not just any old dude, that is preposterous. You mortals lack..."
    j "Here catch."
    "Jack throws the hat he is wearing at Zeus."
    j "Try putting that on. It is one of my hand-made leather hats. Hopefully this can give this post something extra."
    z "I don't see what difference this hat will make but I will follow your lead farmer."
    "Zeus puts on the hat and poses for another picture."
    j "And done."
    j "Well it's something. I guess I will just post it and hope for the best."
    z "Alright, and what next."
    j "Now we wait."
    z "That's it?"
    j "Yep, got to give the people time so see it and spread it around. Let's head back inside and we can check on it tomorrow. I will cook us up something good for dinner."
    z "I will not decline your offering."
    "The pair headed home for the rest of the day."
